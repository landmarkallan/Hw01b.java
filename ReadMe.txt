I put the file data into a 2D array, and while doing so, got the highest, lowest, and the ticker names into a string array, to reduce operations, all this brunt work, within my ' Read_file_Data ' Function. The rest of my Functions are pretty self-explanatory ~ straight-forward.

I had lots of troubleshooting that I've fixed up, and now my program mostly works, except the chunk I mention about below. Lots of learning new things with Java, due to the troubleshooting, I have to deal with.

I'm still troublshooting my last chunk of code, the menu option 1 (my ' GetStockStats ' Function). Currently, can't figure out what's causing the null pointer, if it's an ' out of index looping bounds ', than I can't see it yet, if it's something else, I'll hopefully be able to figure it out eventually.
